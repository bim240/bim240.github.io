Let’s continue what we did in the last article. Here we will cover more of the CSS part. We will cover eight different topics today, starting from CSS reset and ending with length. By the time we finish this article, we will take another step towards a full-stack developer. We won't get into the syntax of these things rather we will discuss how to use them and when to use them effectively. let's begin.
CSS Reset
There are different browsers in the market today. Each browser is developed by a different set of developers. So each browser has its own value for each tag in html. We use reset code in CSS to set almost all the necessary tag values to zero or simply reset it. The reset code is available on the internet. The most famous reset code is Eric Meyer’s reset.
Cascading
Cascading is also a part of CSS’s name. it simply means that pass (something) on to a succession of others. So CSS goes from top to bottom, one after the other. Selector which is defined later has precedence over selector defined earlier unless it has a specificity weight problem.
Specificity weight of selector
Among selectors, the id selector has the highest weight followed by class and type selector. Their weight is as follows 1–0–0, 0–1–0, and 0–0–1. Specificity comes before cascading.
Combining selector
When a developer wants to target a specific element or tag but that tag is also being used in the other part of code than we use combining selector for that purpose. We write parent selector ending with the child name where we wanna implement it. A space between the consecutive selector is a must.
Layering styles with multiple classes
Working on a big project there are many sets of properties that are used in many many selectors. So we make a separate selector with the set of those properties which can we used again and again. We can assign multiple classes to a tag. We also use multiple classes when we want the same target at different places to have different properties.
Common CSS Property & Values
Every selector has some properties like margin, padding, color and many more. Their values can be in pixels, color names, and depending on one's creativity.
Colors
There are basically four ways in which we can implement color in CSS. They are through the name of the color, Hexadecimal color code, RGB color, HSL color. An effective way to use a color depends on oneself. It comes with more and more practice.
Lengths
There are two ways in which we can decide the length in CSS. Absolute length and relative length. Absolute length is good in the beginning but try to switch to relative length asap. In responsive web design, we use relative length.
These are a few conclusions I came to as I am learning Html & CSS.
